<p>I think this is the first time in <strong>my career</strong> that it's mixed with just, it's just, it's nice. <br>It's such a <em>good feeling</em>.</p>

<p>And I think even though we haven't had anybody in the <strong>stands</strong>, our <em>Australian</em> team has been so close here. <br>I think everyone's been so on top of everybody's results. <br>So I think every teammate in athletics, or part of athletics, it's all really been <em>moving together</em>, which is so nice.</p>

<p>So yeah, no these games have been, have been <strong>really different</strong>, but just <strong><em>really, really special</em></strong>. </p>
